# The-Elekna-Watch

# Project created specifically for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85
# The demo project they provided never worked so adjusted some of the code for the drivers for display and lvgl.

# This project includes code for a LVGL UI with a start page and a analog clock ui.
# It gets time via wifi connection and bluetooth exists but is commented out for now.
# It also supports a battery such as a Lipo battery. (I reccommend at least 350 mAh.

# Will include a 3d print file here later on that fits that specific board.
